    <h3>A Passion is Born</h3>

    <p id="P1">My journey with photography began 14 years ago when I
      transferred schools and moved from my native St. Louis to Chicago in
      the middle of winter and the start of the Spring, 2007 Semester. While I
      pretty much loathed the city from early on, a couple life-changing
      things did happen to me: My roommate gave me his old camera and
      showed pictured from Yellowstone National Park-a place he worked the
      previous summer and I used to go to with my family as a kid but had
      long forgotten about. </p>
    <p id="P1">To stay sane and get through the rest of the semester Shane
      and I would explore the city whenever we got a chance, photographing
      the people and whatever else caught our eye. As soon as the semester
      ended however, I packed up and moved to Yellowstone for the summer and
      my love for adventure and the American West was reborn! I was
      infatuated with the freedom of the mountain and would spend my free
      time hiking and exploring the park taking pictures of waterfalls,
      wolfs, sunsets, etc.</p>
    <p id="P1">The summer eventually came and ended and by chance that
      winter was my parents 25th wedding anniversary, for which they took my
      sisters and I to Belize. In the brief two weeks that we were there
      however, my fascination for mountains and adventure was extended to
      the entire world and different cultures.</p>
    <p id="P1">I returned to the States and worked another season in
      Yellowstone, this time as a raft guide, where I proceeded to befriend
      a group of Colombians as-I already spoke a little Spanish- that were
      there for the summer to work. That combined with inspiration to
      travel from my boss who was also a wildlife photographer and had been
      all around the world, and my head guide who was South African and whom
      had been also been to countless countries and I decided that winter to
      travel through Latin America without any plans of coming back.</p>

<h3>Getting Lost in the World and Discovering Culture</h3>
  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph" >I boarded a plan to San Jose, Costa Rica a couple months later and
    spent the next couple months traveling through Costa Rica, Panama and
    eventually even sailed to Colombia, a country I quickly fell in love
    with, and spent the next 4 months there exploring everything from the
    mountains to the sun soaked beaches of the Caribbean and in that time
    realized how much I loved not only getting lost in world and
    discovering something new every day, but also how much I had grown to
    love meeting new people and exploring diverse cultures and how
    photography was also a means to delve beyond simple talking briefly
    with someone, but was rather a way to connect with people and their
    customs and create real connections in a place where I would otherwise
    simply be looked at as a foreigner.</p>

    <h3>The Adventure Continues</h3>
  <p>When the Spring started to roll around again, I longed to be back in the mountains of Montana and with my friends
  rafting on the river and fishing or hiking on our time off. By the time the summer ended and the cold Autumn winds
  started to blow however I started to dream of where else in the world I could go explore with my camera and I took off
  yet again to Colombia with a friend and ended up staying another 4 months.</p>
  
  <p> The next 7+ years went about the same as my
  fascination with the world, it’s people, photography and adventure and the great outdoors was undying. In that time, I
  traveled to Thailand, Nepal, India, Ethiopia, Kenya (where I worked as a rafting guide for 5 months and was able to
  travel at times as well). Uganda, Rwanda, Morocco, Spain, Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia-my favorite country to date
  and a place I have gone back to many times.</p>

<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>With all my effort-not to mention money-spent on traveling and photographing the world, it was nice to finally achieve something with my photography when in 2018 I applied and won the <a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/create/scholarships/photography/2018/results"> World Nomads’Travel Photography Scholarship.</a>  </p>
    
    <P>I was sent on an all-expenses-payed trip to Morocco for two weeks with a professional photographer who mentored me and showed me what it takes to photograph at the professional level.  Those nearly two weeks were invaluable, and I learned a lot of techniques that I use daily to this day and while the trip didn’t do anything to jump-start a career in travel photography, it gave me a lot of confidence and motivation to keep pushing, exploring the world and following my dreams. </p>

 <h3>What the Future Holds</h3>

<p>While my undying desire to explore the world non-stop for months on end is slowly diminishing SLIGHTY and I am focusing more on my professional goals-namely a coding course I am currently in-I still have plans to travel in the future and to keep exploring countries that are calling my attention.</p>
    
    <p> Specifically the Philippines, Indonesia, Cuba, Brazil, Peru and Bolivia are very high on my list.  </p>
    
    <p>By next year I hope to know enough in the coding world to secure a remote position with a reputable company, which would allow me the freedom to be almost anywhere in the world, but to still maintain a career and save money to eventually buy a house in my native St. Louis close to family. Because after all, you can travel the world over, but there’s nothing like being close to the people that love you the most!</p>
